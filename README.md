# EO Mini

_Home Assistant component to integrate with [EO Mini chargers](https://www.eocharging.com/support/home-charging/eo-mini)._

Note that the EO Mini Pro 3 uses a different app than this Home Assistant integration. If you are able to use the "EO Smart Home" app to log in, this integration should work, but not if you use the "EO Charging" app.

## Installation (HACS - preferred)

1. Add this repo as a custom repository in HACS: https://github.com/twhittock/eo_mini (for instructions on how to add a custom repository you can visit https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/)
2. Add EO Mini Charger component.
4. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "EO Mini" enter username & password from the app.

## Installation (manual)

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `eo_mini`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/eo_mini/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "EO Mini"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/eo_mini/translations/en.json
custom_components/eo_mini/translations/nb.json
custom_components/eo_mini/translations/sensor.nb.json
custom_components/eo_mini/__init__.py
custom_components/eo_mini/api.py
custom_components/eo_mini/binary_sensor.py

custom_components/eo_mini/const.py
custom_components/eo_mini/manifest.json
custom_components/eo_mini/sensor.py

```
